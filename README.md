# Wavefront-Planner
Python implementation of wavefront planner for navigation in obstacle ridden environment.

Open the .py file in a python ide

Make sure you have shapely module installed for the code to work.
To install shapely try the following:-
conda install shapely (if you are using anaconda)
pip install shapely (for other ide)

Press the run command

The program requires the user to input vertices and number of edges for the obstacles.
Please follow the on-screen instructions to enter information in the correct way, especially for the vertices.

The user cannot specify start and goal points as they have been defined in code.
To set new start and goal point, make changes in the code itself where they have been assigned values.

If any error occurs, please do revert back to me. Otherwise, the code should run fine.
